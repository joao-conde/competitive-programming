# IEEE Extreme 2018

InvalidNameException

For almost 40h we stayed up, since we work to do during the day prior to the competition start here at 1 a.m. in Portugal. We did not get much sleep during the event either...

Anyways, this was our first IEEExtreme and we enjoyed it a lot.
We were 4th in Portugal ladder until we dropped to 5th right in the last hour. None the less, we still learned, had fun and got a decent spot!

We did not solve all the problems (obviously) but I intend to post solutions to most of them here.
However, during the 24h competition we solved (partially or totally):

* Bear-sums
* Brackets
* Drawing Binary Trees
* Lemons
* Troll
* Product
* Make Distinct
