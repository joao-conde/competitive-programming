# Competitive Programming

Solutions for programming contests and practice exercises from online judges.

The solutions implemented are my own and they are often a product of quick thinking and coding. I do not intend to make enterprise-level software but only to solve the problem as quickly and as efficiently as required (and to have fun of course). Also, in a competitive environment, the programming style changes a lot (more global variables, shorter variable names, ...).
