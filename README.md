# Competitive Programming Contests

Training exercises from online judges and from programming competitions.

The solutions implemented are my own and they are often a product of quick thinking and coding. I do not intend to make super good 'quality' code I only intend to come up with a program to solve the problem as quickly and as efficiently as required (and to have fun of course). Still I try to keep it clean.

Also, the programming style for a competitive environment changes a lot. 

Some code was provided by the professors at FEUP, namely the data structures used in graph algorithms and these aswell.
