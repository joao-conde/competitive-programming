 *   1 - Knapsack 0/1 problem: for a set of items with different weights and values find the optimal subset of items 
 *   that maximizes value and minimizes weight
 *	
 *	2 - It's '0/1' because you either choose the item or you don't (there problems where partial items can be envolved)
 *
 *	3 - Dynamic programming is basically using memoization to avoid repeating computations already made, storing these values
 *	in a data structure with linear (O(1)) access time
