*   1 - binary search algorithm for problems like this, well explained at:
*		https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-correct-approach-to-solve-the-SPOJ-problem-Aggressive-cow
*
*	2 - we know the possible smallest value (0, all cows in sequential stalls) and the biggest one
*		(max distance stall minus the first, simulating 2 cows at each edge)
*
*	3 - we also know that if a value X of distance cannot be satisfied then for any Y > X
*		Y cannot be satisfied aswell -> this property is called monotonicity condition and 
*		it is necessary for binary search
*
*	4 - all we need is a function that checks if a given X can be satisfied given the number of cows
*		and stalls and each of their distances
