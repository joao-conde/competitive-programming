## Hall of Fame

Some solutions to problems which I considered relevant and will later review before competitions.
Tried to group them by theme but some either have none or use many to reach a solution.
Also, I might have forgot some interesting ones.

## Binary Search

* [**AGGRCOW**](https://www.spoj.com/problems/AGGRCOW/) ([MySolution](https://github.com/joao-conde/competitive-programming/blob/master/spoj/aggrcow.cpp))
Place cows in different barn stalls maximizing the minimum distance between each one.

* [**PIE**](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PIE/) ([MySolution](https://github.com/joao-conde/competitive-programming/blob/master/spoj/pie.cpp))
How much of a slice does every friend get from multiple pies, binary search using reals instead of integers.


## Dynamic Programming

* [**PARTY**](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PARTY/) ([MySolution](https://github.com/joao-conde/competitive-programming/blob/master/spoj/party.cpp))
Find the set of parties to attend maxmizing fun rate and minimizing costs. 0/1 knapsack approach.

* [**COINS**](https://www.spoj.com/problems/COINS/) ([MySolution](https://github.com/joao-conde/competitive-programming/blob/master/spoj/coins.cpp))
Mix of pure recursion with dynamic programming (memoization) since input is too large and we can't store it all.

* [**TRT**](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TRT/) ([MySolution](https://github.com/joao-conde/competitive-programming/blob/master/spoj/trt.cpp))
Dynamic programming top-down approach for clear recursive solutions.

* [**TWENDS**](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TWENDS/) ([MySolution](https://github.com/joao-conde/competitive-programming/blob/master/spoj/twends.cpp))
Top-down approach with interesting twist: one step is dp another is a greedy algorithm.


## Binary Search + Dynamic Programming

* [**AMR11A**](https://www.spoj.com/problems/AMR11A/) ([MySolution](https://github.com/joao-conde/competitive-programming/blob/master/spoj/amr11a.cpp))
Find the minimum initial strength for Harry Potter to transverse a magical grid of enemies and allies. Solution identical to SHROOMS.

* [**SHROOMS**](https://www.spoj.com/problems/SHROOMS/) ([MySolution](https://github.com/joao-conde/competitive-programming/blob/master/spoj/shrooms.cpp))
Find the minimum initial shrooms for a guy to transverse a forest of wild boars and shrooms. Solution identical to AMR11A.


## Graphs

* [**GCPC11J**](https://www.spoj.com/problems/GCPC11J/) ([MySolution](https://github.com/joao-conde/competitive-programming/blob/master/spoj/gcpc11j.cpp))
Find the optimal place for a router in a network by calculating the tree diameter.

* [**MICEMAZE**](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MICEMAZE/) ([MySolution](https://github.com/joao-conde/competitive-programming/blob/master/spoj/gcpc11j.cpp))
Usage of multiple dijkstra shortest path in graph algorithm calls instead of Floyd (slower).


## Disjoint sets

* [**FOXLINGS**](https://www.spoj.com/problems/FOXLINGS/) ([MySolution](https://github.com/joao-conde/competitive-programming/blob/master/spoj/foxlings.cpp))
Usage of a disjoint data set to find groups of foxes based on friendships.


## Mathematics

* [**BREAKING**](https://www.spoj.com/problems/BREAKING/) ([MySolution](https://github.com/joao-conde/competitive-programming/blob/master/spoj/breaking.cpp))
Prime factorization solved using Eratosthenes' Sieve.

* [**CANDY3**](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CANDY3/) ([MySolution](https://github.com/joao-conde/competitive-programming/blob/master/spoj/candy3.cpp))
Modulo properties.

* [**ONP**](https://www.spoj.com/problems/ONP/) ([MySolution](https://github.com/joao-conde/competitive-programming/blob/master/spoj/onp.cpp))
Reverse Polish Notation using a stack.
